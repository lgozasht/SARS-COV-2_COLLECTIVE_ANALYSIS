# SARS-COV-2_COLLETIVE_ANALYSIS

We previously developed a program in python3 that flags possible lab-associated variants in SARS-CoV-2 data (see https://github.com/lgozasht/COVID-19-Lab-Specific-Bias-Filter). This repository hosts our improved pipeline which employs similar methods as *COVID-19-Lab-Specific-Bias-Filter* but includes additional modifications. 

We describe these modifications in detail in https://virological.org/t/issues-with-sars-cov-2-sequencing-data/473/12.
